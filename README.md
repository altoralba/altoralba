### Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Al Zevastien Toralba and I'm a Mobile App and Game Developer. Besides programming, I enjoy anime-related media and memes.

## A few personal details:
- ðŸ“± I primarily started as a native Android Developer.
- ðŸ’» I'm currently learning [React JS](https://reactjs.org/) for Web Development and [ASP.NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/?view=aspnetcore-6.0) for Software Development.
- ðŸŽ® I've had experience using different game engines, but I chose [Unity](https://unity.com/) as my main preference.
