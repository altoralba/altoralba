### Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Al Zevastien Toralba and I'm a Fullstack Software Developer by day and Game Dev enthusiast at night.

## A few personal details:
- ðŸ“± I started professionally as a native Android Developer and gained extensive experience on fullstack development over the years.
- ðŸ’» I'm currently working as a Software Developer while studying about newer and emerging technologies.
- ðŸŽ® I like brainstorming and developing game concepts in my spare time. I primarily use [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) as my main game engine preference.

I don't update a lot of my code here as most of the projects I've worked on are closed-source, but feel free to browse through my public repositories!
